Birthday Reminder

I decided to use C language as it was the most used one thruout the course and I created a type of database where the user can include, delete, edit and get notifications of upcoming birthdays.

The code idea was to create a reminder so the program can be used as an appointment diary as well.

It also can be adpted to sent email alert when the event is coming.
